	<h2>About U&MUN</h2>
	<div class="letter">
<p>Founded in July 2015, U&MUN is an initiative started by four high school students driven by the sole motive of attaining world peace. What started as an introductory workshop for the students of the Jayshree Periwal International School, has grown into a well reputed venture in the field of Model United Nations. The aim of the founders is to provide a society with the quality experiences that they have gained in their years of participating in various Model United Nation conferences throughout the world. A MUN is a platform which aims to be an authentic simulation of the United Nations. This is achieved via the recreation of various committee and agencies at the UN. It also includes a wide range of further sub-committees, a secretariat held by the secretary general, an International press and of course the delegates. Not only does U&MUN bring with it a quality delegate experience, a stellar executive board and rigorous debate, but it has managed to reinvent itself in the best possible manner. After holding several informative workshops as well as an intense conference last year, the organisation was met with immense success and positive reinforcement. With this in mind, the founders are proud to present the second edition of the U&MUN conference on the 6th, 7th and 8th April 2018, with support of the JPIS ModelUN Club.</p>

 <h2>About JPIS</h2>
<p>They say that Rome wasn’t built in a day and the ones who put forth their heart and sole are the ones who truly realise the worth of their work. With a similar ideology, our Director, Dr. Jayshree Periwal, started her journey from scratch, building one preschool and has climbed the ladder to success, mothering thousands of students throughout several branches across the state. It is with this determination that she was able to land Jayshree Periwal International seventh on the list of the best schools in the country.</p>

<p>We are the modern JPites, the students of Jayshree Periwal International School. Each one of us has some talent and the honing of that talent begins in great earnest. We are taught to give back to the society from which we draw our sustenance and to care for the underprivileged. We invent, we push the human race forward. We make a difference and change the world for the better. We see ourselves as truly global citizens – rooted to tradition and yet ready to face the world. Hence, we believe that participating in Model United Nations goes a long way in shaping an individual. The varied hues of discussion, debate, drafting and diplomacy add colours to our personality by improving our confidence, inter-personal skills, reasoning and oratory skills.</p>

<p>What guarantees the quality of debate and level of expertise is the sheer number of MUNs our secretariat has participated and won in, ranging from local to international level MUNs.</p>

<p>JPIS has hosted not only its own MUN, but has also hosted WIMUN 2014, an international Model United Nations hugely reputed throughout the globe and has also taken part in several MUNs held all over the world. It is of no surprise then, that our school is looking to expand its horizons in the field of MUNing by hosting the second edition of the U&MUN conference.</p>
